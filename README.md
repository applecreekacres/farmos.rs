# FarmOS.rs

A Rust library for the FarmOS API.

The goal of this library is to act an access point to the FarmOS API. This is meant to be able to connect to any instance of FarmOS, whether self hosted or hosted by Farmier.

This library takes inspiration from the existing FarmOS API libraries [FarmOS.py](https://github.com/farmos/farmos.py) and [FarmOS.js](https://github.com/farmos/farmos,js)
